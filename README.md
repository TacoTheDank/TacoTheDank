If you couldn't tell from my commits, I'm obsessed with keeping stuff up-to-date.

Also, I hold a particular love for emulation. Consequently, I follow a number of emulator repositories far too large to list here, but can be found in [this file](https://github.com/TacoTheDank/TacoTheDank/blob/main/README-CONTINUED.md) if you want to read it for some reason.

My current personal projects are:
- https://gitlab.com/TacoTheDank/APKMirror (Android app client for APKMirror)
- https://github.com/TacoTheDank/Scoop (Catches a stack trace when an app crashes unexpectedly)
- https://github.com/TacoTheDank/text_converter (An app that converts text to all sorts of stuff)

I mainly contribute to various projects that I hold an interest in, or to which I just feel like contributing.
Some I contribute to regularly, others every once in a while.

Projects that hold my interest are in my pins, and also include (because there isn't enough space in pins):
- https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid
- https://github.com/TwidereProject/TwidereX-Android
- https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-Experimental

...and [more](https://github.com/TacoTheDank/TacoTheDank/blob/main/README-CONTINUED.md)!
