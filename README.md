### Long live open-source!

I like keeping stuff up-to-date.

My primary interest is in Android and Android-related open-source projects.
I mostly contribute to various projects that interest me, or to which I just feel like contributing.
Usually that's because I see something that I think can be improved, and then I try to improve it.

My main focuses are usually on NewPipe ([@TeamNewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe)) and AntennaPod.

Here are my stats (because why not):
