### Hello! You're visitor number <img src="https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=TacoTheDank.visitor-badge&color=d391e2" />. Thanks for checking me out, even if you didn't mean to :)

#### Long live open-source!

ðŸ’• ViewPager2 is bae ðŸ’•

I'm obsessed with keeping stuff up-to-date (if you couldn't tell from my repetitive commits).

My current personal projects are:
- https://gitlab.com/TacoTheDank/APKMirror (Android app client for APKMirror)
- https://github.com/TacoTheDank/Scoop (Catches a stack trace when an app crashes unexpectedly)
- https://github.com/TacoTheDank/text_converter (An app that converts text to all sorts of stuff)

Yeah, they're forks, but one day I'll write some apps of my own ;)

I mainly contribute to various projects that interest me, or to which I just feel like contributing.
Some I contribute to regularly, others every once in a while.

The main projects I like to be involved in (in one way or another) are pinned, and also include these five (because there aren't enough slots in pins):
- https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid
- https://github.com/TwidereProject/TwidereX-Android
- https://github.com/K1rakishou/Kuroba-Experimental
- https://github.com/SkyTubeTeam/SkyTube
- https://github.com/YTVanced/VancedManager (come join the Vanced discord! :^))

Here's some [more projects](https://github.com/TacoTheDank/TacoTheDank/blob/main/README-CONTINUED.md) that I also like to dry my eyes out staring at.

If you read all this... thank you c:
